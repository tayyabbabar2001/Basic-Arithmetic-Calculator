# Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator

**Presenting my debut project - the "Basic Arithmetic Calculator" in C++. Crafted during my free time, this calculator showcases my passion for coding, thirst for learning, and desire to experiment. Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and calculate the modulo with ease! An exciting first step into the world of programming, inspiring a journey of exploration and self-improvement.**

The Basic Arithmetic Calculator is a simple console-based C++ program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two input numbers, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.

**Features:**
Addition: The program takes two integer inputs, 'x' and 'y', and calculates their sum using the '+' operator.
Subtraction: Similarly, the program computes the difference between 'y' and 'x' using the '-' operator.
Multiplication: The program uses the '*' operator to calculate the product of 'x' and 'y'.
Division: The program employs the '/' operator to divide 'y' by 'x' and calculates the quotient.
Modulo: Lastly, the program utilizes the '%' operator to find the remainder (modulo) when 'y' is divided by 'x'.

**How to use:**

Run the program.
You will be prompted to enter the first number 'x'.
After entering 'x', the program will request you to input the second number 'y'.
The program will then display the results of the arithmetic operations.


**Note:**

The calculator only accepts integer inputs for 'x' and 'y'.
Division by zero is not handled in this version of the calculator and may result in undefined behavior.
